## Palmoria Group
The Palmoria Group is a manufacturing based company in Nigeria
## Task Focus
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.

## Pointers
 1.What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments 

2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
 
3. Analyze the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
   
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
- How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
